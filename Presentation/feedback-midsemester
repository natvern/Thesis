- Presentation was confusing. Should explain earlier what is meant by a safe controller 
and what reinforcement learning actually looks like.
- Give a more complex scenario for car-platooning. Include uncertainties and adverserial input and why the problem is important
and moreover complex enough to require optimization. (Not a freshman-year physics problem)
- Present the differences in scenario representation in SC vs RL earlier cause it helps understand the problem better. 
- Include some related work and how our work relates vs improves. 
- Presentation skills -> stop "hm" and spend more time with each slide, went over it too fast.
