\section{Optimization} \label{optimality} 



\subsection{Compile once Evaluate many}
Since the grounding of the problog program is dependent on the query, it is possible to first compile the model 
to a problog internal format and ground all possible queries and evidence specified in the model. This allows us 
to compile once and evaluate many. This can help with the optimization of our program, since our files can be defined into 
(1) rules, (2) world knowledge base and (3) labels as explained in \ref{sec:modules}. (1) and (3) are constants, while the dynamics 
of the world (2) change at every given timestep. We can then initially ground the constants and later 
extend the database to incorporate the environment knowledge. 
 
Further work needs to be done as the grounding breaks the multiprocessing capabilities of training the reinforcement learning. 
Another direction could be to incorporate evidence-based probabilities which allows us to query \dio easily.

\subsection{Feedback n-steps} 
Another possible optimization is to query \dio every n steps, rather than every 1 step. In the 
following, we evaluate the tradeoff between optimality and speed of training when increasing $n$.

As expected by decreasing the number of times we call \dio, we were able to reduce the 
training time considerably. By half for $n=2$, a third in $n=3$, etc. Overall, the change of optimality 
between $n=1$ and $n=2$ is negligeable, as the success percentage drops from $90\%$ to $87\%$. 
The mean return drops by $0.9$, although the max reward does not change much. 
Starting from $n=3$ and $n=4$, we gain a lot in performance but we lose almost all optimality. 
A visualization of the resulting policy shows that the agent almost never reaches the goal, similarly to the 
implementation without \dio. In conclusion, $n=2$ is the best optimization.
