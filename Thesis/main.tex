  %% The story

  %% There is this great new method!
  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful AI method that does not
  require pre-gathered data but relies on a trial-and-error process
  for the agent to learn. 
  %
  This is made possible through a reward function that associates
  current state configurations to a numerical value. 
  %
  The agent's goal is then to maximize its cumulative reward over its
  lifetime. 
  % 
  %% Oh, but there are some issues...
  Unfortunately, there is no systematic method to design a reward
  function.
  %
  This needs to be done on a case by case basis, and might be hard
  depending on how the states are represented.
  %
  States are typically represented as vector of values in RL, and
  translating properties and rules from a domain into this
  representation can be complicated depending on how many values are
  used, what they represent, whether they are normalized or not, etc.


%  \medskip

  % This is needed to connect the ideas from the previous paragraph
  % and the next.

%%   %% No problem, we can solve them!
%%   These challenges can be alleviated for a given domain by fine
%%   tuning the reward function with domain specific information. 
%%   %
%%   For example, if the agent is a self-driving car, the reward function
%%   can include the physics equations to predict, with some degree of
%%   certainty, the car's trajectory for the next few seconds.
%%   %
%%   By looking into the future, the reward function can penalize bad
%%   behavior before it reaches a catastrophic state (\emph{e.g.}, a
%%   crash).
%%   %
%%   A better reward function prunes the (often infinite) search space
%%   faster, allowing the agent to explore (breadth) new states instead
%%   of exploiting (depth) dead ends.
%%   %
%%   %% Oh, but only on a case by case basis...
%%   However, tuning the reward might be hard depending on the domain and
%%   how states are represented.
%%   %
%%   States are typically represented as vector of values in RL, and
%%   translating properties and rules from a domain into this

%  \medskip

  %% We can fix that!
  We propose a \emph{Domain Informed Oracle (DIO)} as a solution for
  systematically incorporating domain specific knowledge into RL
  reward functions.
  %
  DIO is a collection of domain specific rules written in a
  declarative language, such as Prolog.
  %
  It does not rely on the RL representation of states, allowing the
  programmer to focus on the domain specific knowledge using an
  expressive and intuitive language, where they can define states and
  rules in the most convenient way.
  %
  DIO provides an informed decision to the reward function, thus
  allowing it to dynamically adapt the rewards. 
  %
  %DIO is incorporated into a RL architecture and is defined by its
  %behavior in relation to the input given by the reward function. 
  
  Our implementation is tested on a grid worl with dynamic obstacles and later extended 
  to a traffic simulation scenario. It is then compared to a basic uninformed RL algorithm. 
  %
  The comparison is based on performance which we define by three
  metrics: time to train, optimality of the learned policy and
  finally, the success percentage, i.e. the number of times it reaches a positive terminal state, a goal 
  for example. 
  
  Our results show that although the time to train is longer, the learned policy using DIO succeeds 
  in 90\% of the time to reach the goal. The policy both incorporates safety by avoiding 
  crashing into an obstacle but also optimality by choosing the fastest possible path. This is not the case with an implementation that only makes use of RL, precisely a proximal policy optimization that 
  does learn safety but always ends its episode in the maximum number of steps, rather than reaching the goal.

\section{Introduction}

Implementing a robust adaptive controller that is effective in terms
of precision, time, and quality of decision
when facing dynamic and uncertain scenarios, has always been a central
challenge in AI and robotics. Precisely, as we want our autonomous agents to be deployed 
in the real world, we want to ensure that they are able to adapt to unforeseen scenarios, as well as 
keep their efficiency. This efficiency is measured in terms of their optimality and time taken to produce a decision. 
%
As autonomous cars are deployed, IoT is popularized, and human-robot interactions become more complex, we
are more and more confronted with the need for robotic agents that can effectively and continually adapt
to their surroundings, not only in simulation, but also in practice, when deployed as a cyber-physical system. 
Since we are unable to provide a repertoire of all possible scenarios and actions,
our agents need to be able to autonomously predict and adapt to new
changes. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach that
supports dynamically adapting to new input. It is also the solution that AlphaGo, Deepmind AlphaStar, and OpenAI Five have
adopted \cite{li2019reinforcement}, respectively for Go, StarCraft II and Dota 2 and found success in. 

\medskip

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool as it does not require
pre-gathered data as most Machine Learning (ML) techniques do. 
%
The general idea of RL is a trial-and-error process guided by a
\textit{domain dependent} reward function.
%
For example, if the agent is a self-driving car, the reward function
can greatly penalize states when it crashes.
%
However, this means that the car is bound to crash to learn not to
crash again.
%
A better reward function can include the physics equations to predict,
with some degree of certainty, the car's trajectory for the next few
seconds.
%
By looking into the future, the reward function can penalize bad
behavior before it reaches a catastrophic state (a crash).
%
A better reward function prunes the (often infinite) search space
faster, allowing the agent to explore (breadth) new states instead of
exploiting (depth) dead ends.
%
%For example, say we want to teach an autonomous car to stop at a STOP
%sign. We will punish it via a negative reward when it does not,
%otherwise, we will reward it. Thus, through multiple iterations, and
%with the goal to maximize its rewards, a reinforcement learning
%trained agent will learn to stop at a STOP sign. 

\medskip

The task of choosing a reward function that ensures optimality is thus
crucial. 
%
In this work, we propose a Domain Informed Oracle (DIO) written in a
declarative language to inform a reinforcement learning algorithm. 
%
Our method provides a systematic way to encode domain specific rules
into a reward function for RL that does not rely on the state
representation within the RL algorithm.
%
We argue that such a combination will ensure a faster and more
efficient RL trained agent in terms of optimality. 
%
The proposed combination is tested on a traffic simulation and the
results are compared with a RL implementation that makes use of
standard practices to design a reward function.

\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, as RL faces the issues of reward shaping, meta-learning and the exploration-exploitation dilemma, domain knowledge show promising results in 
improving reinforcement learning methods. The main challenge is to make such an integration seamless, and independent of the AI implementation. 
As we start incorporating our modules into one architecture to test on our Traffic Simulator in Section \ref{traffic}, we will be able to show preliminary 
results. Similarly, we look further into the specifications of DIO to ensure that it informs the scenario in a meaningful way as discussed in Section \ref{scspecs}.
